# Known issues

Things found during the upgrade and deliberately left alone. None blocks the deploy.

## Behaviour

1. _Fixed._ Date fields used the UTC day (`toISOString().substring(0, 10)`): a search at
   00:30 Berlin time sent the previous day. `$lib/localDate` now formats and parses the local
   date parts everywhere a date is picked or shown (search forms, `/clubs` heading, bar event
   defaults, promoter event `min`).
2. **Spotify token refresh never stores the new expiry** (`spotify/search/+page.server.ts`):
   the refreshed expiry is computed but the `spotifyTokenExpiry` cookie is not updated, so
   every request refreshes again.
3. _Fixed._ `/clubs`, `/barfindr` and `/promoter-home` returned 500 when opened without the
   expected cookies (no city / not logged in); they now redirect to `/` and `/login/bars`.
   A city without a date also redirects (`/barfindr` used to fall back to the server's day).
4. **`/bars` without the Spotify flow has no `barId`**, so creating a bar event posts to
   `/api/bars//events` (404). The dashboard assumes Spotify has been connected.
5. _Partly fixed._ The rate limiter trusted `X-Forwarded-For` / `CF-Connecting-IP` as sent;
   it now keys on `event.getClientAddress()`, i.e. the header the deployment declares with
   `ADDRESS_HEADER`/`XFF_DEPTH` (see `.env.example`). Still per process memory (fine for the
   single PM2 instance), and requests without the trusted header share one bucket.
6. _Fixed._ Password reset e-mails hard-coded `https://www.clubfindr.com`; the link now uses
   the request origin (`ORIGIN` in production). Mail goes through `$lib/email`, configured
   by `SMTP_*` and `MAIL_TRANSPORT` at runtime (see `.env.example`).

## Code health

7. **Colour classes outside the palette** (`text-gray-700`, `bg-blue-500`, … 174 uses).
   They generate no Tailwind CSS; `app.css` themes through attribute selectors on the class
   names (`[class*='bg-gray-']`, `[class*='text-']`). Replacing that with real palette
   tokens is a design refactor; until then the names must stay.
8. **`.feature-icon` colour on the home page** was never applied (the old variable held an
   RGB triplet). Left as it renders; `color: rgb(var(--rgb-secondary))` would colour it.
9. **Legacy-syntax dependencies**: `date-picker-svelte` and `lucide-svelte` are Svelte 4
   style components (excluded from forced runes mode). Fine, but they will not move to
   Svelte 6 without updates.
10. **`jsonwebtoken` on Node 26** crashes (`buffer-equal-constant-time` needs the removed
    `SlowBuffer`); Node 24 is LTS until April 2028, so this only matters for the next Node
    bump (swap to `jose` or patch the dependency).
11. **`src/routes/api/spotify/artists/+page.svelte`** is a stub page living next to an API
    endpoint; `src/stores/genres.svelte.ts` is only read by it and never written.
12. **`hooks.server.ts` logs every non-asset request** and the login endpoint logs request
    shapes; noisy in `pm2 logs`.
13. **SvelteKit 3** is still prerelease (`3.0.0-next.*`); revisit when it ships.
14. **`svelte/no-navigation-without-resolve` and `svelte/prefer-svelte-reactivity`** are
    off in `eslint.config.js` (moot with an empty base path / false positives on local
    temporaries). Re-evaluate if either assumption changes.
15. **SMTP transport skips certificate verification** (`src/lib/email.ts`,
    `tls.rejectUnauthorized: false`): a man-in-the-middle on the SMTP connection would go
    unnoticed. Left as is for now because the mail host may present a certificate that does
    not match; flip it to `true` and test against the real host before removing.
16. **`/api/request-access` builds its own Gmail transport** (`smtp.gmail.com` with
    `GMAIL_USER`/`GMAIL_PASS`) instead of going through `$lib/email`, with the same
    `rejectUnauthorized: false`. It is the one endpoint that bypasses the configurable mail
    transport, so it still sends real mail in any environment that has the Gmail credentials.
17. **Postgres `DATE` columns pass through the server's timezone.** `src/lib/db.ts` sets no
    type parser, so node-pg turns `event_date` into a JS `Date` at server-local midnight;
    JSON then serialises it as the previous day's `T22:00Z`/`T23:00Z` (the server is in
    Germany). `BarEventModal.svelte` (`new Date(eventDetails.event_date).toISOString()`)
    saves the previous day when an existing bar event is edited, and the mobile API does the
    same with stored dates (`api/mobile/bars/matching`). The mobile API also still uses the
    UTC day for "today" (`api/mobile/events`, `api/mobile/bars/matching`,
    `api/mobile/bars/[barId]/stats`), outside the #1 fix. Likely fix:
    `types.setTypeParser(1082, (v) => v)` so `DATE` stays a `YYYY-MM-DD` string end to end,
    plus a client-supplied date for the mobile "today" cases.
